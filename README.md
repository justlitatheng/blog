So far, I've been able to load the site up: 

* localhost:3000
* localhost:3000/authors/sign-in (email: amanada@example.com, password: 123456) 
* localhost:3000/posts (to see the posts)

* 6/22/2021

* ERROR occurs when the post 'testing 1' is clicked on in localhost:3000/posts. Site crashes, check console for error message.
